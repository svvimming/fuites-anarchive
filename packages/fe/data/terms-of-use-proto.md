### a few things to consider before uploading/manipulating media on fuit.es

fuit.es seeks to facilitate collaboration within a trusting atmosphere by offering a free creative space and experimental architecture. This space is designed to afford new kinds of relation outside the profit-oriented framework of other “free” social media platforms. Developers and designers of the platform do not lay claim to any ownership of users' data. The token system is designed to protect the anonymity of users within the database. **fuit.es is not to be held responsible for surveilling what files a user chooses to upload, and is not to be held responsible for the manipulation and deletion of any files within the platform.** 

What is uploaded to fuit.es does not necessarily reflect values or positions held by the wider community of users on the platform, or by the designers and developers of the platform. **Rather than reserve the right to profile and ban particular users, fuit.es extends the right to any user with a token to delete and curate the space according to their own desires and needs.**

**fuit.es is not a private space.** While the complexity of a page or verse name (example: fuit.es/fog/jelly-123456789098765) can render the chances quite low of someone stumbling upon them by accident, all pages on fuit.es are technically reachable to anyone. While a token is required to manipulate media, all page's contents are made visible to whoever searches it. We encourage users to treat the space like a sandbox in a playground, a collective mural (where nothing happens in a vacuum).

**If you have any concerns or questions about the contents of a page, or about the uploading, removal or alteration of certain media, please contact us at contact@fuit.es**
