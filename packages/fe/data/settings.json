These individual media objects are referred to as \"thingies\". Anyone with a token can create a verse, a public network of pages for anarchiving thingies. If you are curious about accessing the platform, get in touch with us by email at contact@fuit.es, we would be happy to make you a token.\n\n###### *We acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts.*\n###### *Nous remercions le Conseil des arts du Canada de son soutien.*",
