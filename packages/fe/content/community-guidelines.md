### A few things to consider before uploading/manipulating media on fuit.es...

_fuit.es_ seeks to facilitate collaboration within a trusting atmosphere by offering a free creative space and an experimental architecture interrogating the profit-oriented framework of other “free” social media platforms. **We do not condone any form of verbal abuse, bullying, hate speech or pornographic content.**

Rather than reserve the right to profile and ban particular users, _fuit.es_ extends the right to any user with a token to delete/edit any uploaded content they come across, according to their own desires and needs. Developers and designers of the platform do not lay claim to any ownership of users' data.

_fuit.es_ is not surveilling what files a user chooses to upload, and is not to be held responsible for the manipulation and deletion of any files within the platform. What is uploaded to _fuit.es_ does not necessarily reflect values or positions held by the wider community of users on the platform, or by the designers and developers of the platform.

**_fuit.es_ is not a private space.** 

While the complexity of a Page or Verse name (example: fuit.es/fog/jelly-123456789098765) can render the chances quite low of someone stumbling upon them by accident, all pages on _fuit.es_ are technically reachable to anyone. While a token is required to manipulate media, all page's contents are made visible to whoever searches it. We encourage users to treat the space like a sandbox in a playground, a collective mural (where nothing happens in a vacuum).

**If you have any concerns or questions about the contents of a page, or about the uploading, removal or alteration of certain media, please contact us at contact@fuit.es**
